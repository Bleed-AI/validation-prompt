# Validation Prompt

## Project Overview
Looking to build complex logic expressions using logical operators such as AND and OR. These expressions are constructed in the frontend, converted to structured JSON, and then sent to the backend for evaluation. The primary goal of this project is to calculate a total score based on the input logic expressions.

## Features
**User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive and user-friendly web interface that enables users to construct complex logic expressions visually.

**Logic Expression Builder:** The frontend provides tools for users to create logical expressions by combining variables and applying logical operators.

**JSON Structure:** The constructed logic expressions are converted into structured JSON format, making it easy to process and evaluate in the backend.

**Backend Evaluation:** The backend of the application is responsible for evaluating the JSON logic expressions and calculating a total score based on the defined rules.
